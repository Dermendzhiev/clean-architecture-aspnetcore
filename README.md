# Clean Architecture

## Summary

Basic implementation of [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) proposed by Uncle Bob.

The project strives to follow the architecture, patterns and naming conventions "by the book".

The implementation uses "Enterprise", "Application", "Interface Adapters" and "Frameworks and Drivers" layers with presenters, controllers, interactors and input/output ports.
